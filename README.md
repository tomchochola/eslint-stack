# [ESlint Stack](https://github.com/premierstacks/eslint-stack) by [Tomáš Chochola](https://github.com/tomchochola)

✨ _**Clone and Win!**_

The ESLint Stack is a comprehensive set of pre-configured ESLint configurations for JavaScript, TypeScript, and React. It simplifies the process of integrating ESLint into projects, ensuring a consistent coding style and enforcing best practices across multiple environments—all with minimal setup effort.

## What is ESLint Stack?

The ESLint Stack is a pre-configured collection of ESLint setups tailored for JavaScript, TypeScript, and React projects. It was created to address the common issues developers face when setting up ESLint manually—such as finding compatible plugins, configuring rules, and resolving conflicts. With this stack, you get a fully-configured environment out of the box, eliminating the need to manually install and configure multiple dependencies.

The configurations are categorized into browser-based, Node-based, and hybrid environments, supporting additional specializations like React or TypeScript. This allows you to use the right setup for any project, whether it’s a frontend application, backend service, or a full-stack solution that requires both environments. Each setup is optimized to provide compatibility and consistency, so you can focus on writing code rather than dealing with configuration details.

Using the ESLint Stack ensures that your projects adhere to a consistent style and standard, no matter how many plugins or rulesets you need to include. It helps reduce errors, streamline code reviews, and makes onboarding new developers easier by providing a unified coding style for all your projects.

This is my personal GitHub profile, where you’ll find public documentation and sample repositories for proprietary packages and templates from Premierstacks. These public repositories are designed to give you an overview of the best practices and high-quality code I follow in all my projects.

## What is Premierstacks

[https://github.com/premierstacks](https://github.com/premierstacks)

Premierstacks is a collection of exclusive, proprietary stacks and templates for PHP, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Laravel. It was created to address the common pain points developers face with many open-source projects—quality, consistency, and maintainability. With Premierstacks, you get high-quality tools built with strict attention to detail, designed to help you build and maintain better projects, faster.

## Why Premierstacks?

I created Premierstacks because I wasn’t satisfied with the quality of many open-source projects. Maintaining high-quality code and ensuring long-term reliability is challenging when you’re not earning from the product. When you pay for something, it means the creator truly cares about its success and is committed to delivering the best possible outcome.

Like Apple’s approach with their closed ecosystem, I believe that true excellence can only be achieved when every detail is under your control. That’s why Premierstacks is proprietary software—it's not just about providing solutions; it’s about ensuring those solutions meet the highest standards.
